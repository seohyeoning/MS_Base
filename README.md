# MS_Base
Thi is my base pipeline for classification of the MS datasets

This is my pipeline code for multimodal fusion experiments
Base_Model.py 
- No additional module for Baseline
- cross-attention + fusion (m=2)

Ori_Model.py 
- I changed tensorflow code to pytorch (reference code is written below)  
- self-attention + fusion (m=5)
